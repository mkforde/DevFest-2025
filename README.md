# Collegiate Dining

## üçΩ The Problem
College dining halls serve as both a source of nutrition and a social gathering space, yet students often struggle to make informed food choices while also coordinating meals with friends. Without proper guidance, students may resort to unhealthy eating habits, miss out on diverse meal options, or find themselves eating alone due to poor planning. Existing dining apps focus on menus and meal swipes but fail to enhance the overall dining experience through both nutritional insights and social connectivity.

## üåü What is Dining U?
